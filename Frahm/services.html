                          Tax Preparation and Planning go hand-in-hand, and this is where your unique needs as a business owner and individual are always accounted for. We provide the necessary preparation, planning and advisory services for your specific needs instead of a blanket, one-size-fits-all approach to taxes. Time and time again, we have found that there’s no substitute for that personal touch when it comes to a client’s tax preparation and planning.<br><br>

                        Tax preparation can often result in significant tax benefits for you and your business, not only in the current year but for years to come.<br><br>

                        Being prepared is what helps your business weather storms; whether on the horizon or still brewing. This is where the staff at Frahm & Associates CPAs takes the time on a regular basis to meet one-on-one with clients to better understand your needs; including any changes that have occurred since we last met.<br><br>

                        Taking this time ensures that our professional team is current with the various aspects of your accounting and taxes, plus it gives YOU time to ask questions.<br><br>

                        We provide current and customized tools for our clients to maintain the best records possible. Not only does this help you maximize your deductions; it also provides a powerful line of defense so that your return should withstand any potential audit.<br><br>

                          If/when the time ever comes that our clients are contacted by any taxing agency, we don’t feel they should stand alone when it comes to an audit or request for information.<br><br>

                        We are always happy to handle an audit on a client’s behalf even if the return was prepared by another firm. With our experience, we know what auditors are looking for, allowing us to take away the guesswork by lining up any and all documentation that is requested. Our goal is to prepare an organized and complete presentation, making the audit process go as smooth as possible for both our client and the auditor.<br><br>

                        <p>
                          We are here for our clients as needed throughout the year, but the most important time to talk about planning is as the end of the year approaches. In November and December, we contact our clients to review projections, eliminate surprises and allow for ample time to make any adjustments needed. Tax planning also includes entity planning for Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies, S Corporations & C Corporations. If you own a business, tax planning could be beneficial for you; just like it has for many of our clients over the years. For corporate officers, wage planning may be one of the most overlooked items when it comes to self-employment and payroll tax savings, appropriate compensation, and income tax withholding.
