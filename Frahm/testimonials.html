                            Tim, we cannot thank you enough for helping us over the years! We love our tax planning sessions every year. They are invaluable – as is your enthusiasm. You have saved us so much time and money – we will never rely on Turbo Tax again.<br><br>

                            Our experience working with Tim has been amazing. My wife and I had very complicated business and personal tax issues that needed special care. Tim took our two lives and various businesses, combined them together efficiently, and helped us wade through the confusing tax world. His knowledge and organization are unmatched in this industry. I recommend him to my clients and look forward to many more years of working with Tim and his staff.<br><br>

                            Since changing over to Frahm & Associates for my 2013 Tax Season I am very pleased with our decision. The services have been everything I have expected. Tim is always easy to reach and is very prompt in getting back to me. I really appreciate our December meeting that allows our company to get an idea sooner than later as to our tax liabilities for the year.<br><br>
